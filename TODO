GOAL:
  [_] Handle HEAD requests
  [_] Handle GET requests

TODO:
  [_] Clean up server code
  [_] Parse request line
  [_] Parse request target
  [_] Write my own assert macro??
  [x] Write tests
  [_] Rewrite parsing code:
        Do not modify the data until it succeeds
        Think about what should happen when it fails
        These two things will complicate things

Suggestions:
  Rename bin to build
  Rename static to www or public?
  readv
  sendfile

Create server
  socket()
  bind()
  listen()

Listen for requests
  accept()
  recv()

Respond to requests
  send()
